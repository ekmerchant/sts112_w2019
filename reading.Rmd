## Week 1
### [The Census, Audiences, and Publics](http://emilyklancher.com/teaching/Anderson.html)
**Margo Anderson, 2008, *Social Science History* 32: 1-18.**

This file takes some time to load and is best viewed in Safari. It includes a video clip that will not run in Chrome. Look at the images as you read, and try to see what Anderson is seeing. Do you see anything she doesn't mention?

## Week 2
###  [Minnesota Historical Census Projects](readings/Minnesota_Historical_Census.pdf) 
**Special issue of *Historical Methods*, 1995 (highlighted sections only).**

As you read, pay attention to the following things:

- What is the difference between published (aggregate, tabular) census data and unpublished census manuscripts (microdata)?
- What are the three key strengths of the IPUMS national census files?
- When and why did the census begin to collect information about individuals rather than households?
- How did disputes over slavery affect the 1850 census?
- What was the conroversy over the 1870 census? Why were new questions proposed, and why did Congress resist?
- How did the audience for the census change at the end of the nineteenth century? How does this relate to last week's reading by Margo Anderson?
- How did census-taking change in 1960?
- Why is it important to get public input into the development of census schedules? How does that relate to the upcoming census in 2020?

These questions will be important for Lab 2:

- When and why were year and month of birth added to the census schedule? Did they solve the problem they were supposed to solve?
- Why are there two different coding schemes for relationship to household head? How was this relationship determined before 1880?
- What are the constructed variables? How are they constructed? What information do they provide? Why and how might you use them?
